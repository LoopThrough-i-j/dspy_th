## Time taken

- Understanding DSPy - Around 1.5hrs( As tt was completely new for me). I did go through:
    - https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy/blob/main/examples/knn.ipynb
    - https://youtu.be/_ROckQHGHsU?si=QUZQkJObIerJlqhk
    - And a few other docs. LLMs does't seem to have much knowledge about the library
- Assignment - Around 1hr(Did it in 2 30min windows)

## Suggested Improvements

- We can put more though on setting up an efficient chain depending on the detailed use case.
- The repository uses some outdated packages, and some functions scheduled for deprecation which needs to be replaced
- Better typing practices can be implemented
- The current repository is structured according to the library DSPy, rather it can be structured according to the problem solved. Since that needs more understanding of the long term goal and full product, this is good for now.


## Struggles

- I am not much used to `poetry`(Hence didn't spend much time to figure issues around it). I usually use `pip` and `uv`
- There were requirements for a few additional packages which I installed locally without reflecting it on the poetry file
